# 💫 About Me:
Hi, I'm Michael Kokaly. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago, working toward a degree with a focus on Software Engineering. What started with a simple toy coding robot as a kid evolved into building projects that solve real problems, from game engines to data analysis tools that process real-world city data.<br><br>Currently, I focus on building systems-level applications and exploring web development, working primarily in C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. I'm especially interested in how software is structured under the hood. Specifically, how data moves through a program, how memory is managed, and how clean design makes code easier to extend and maintain. Alongside my coursework I've been teaching myself web development, building toward creating full applications for real users and organizations.<br><br>My long-term goal is to work as a software engineer building platforms that make people's everyday lives easier and more connected. I'm especially interested in roles where I can grow into full-stack or backend development, contribute to real products used by real people, and continue expanding my understanding of how great software is designed from the ground up.
